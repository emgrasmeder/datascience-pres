## Packages to install
- [Anaconda]()
- [NLTK]()
  - [NLTK extras]()

You can also skip the `Anaconda` install and install these packages separately:
(please raise an issue or submit a pull request here if you found dependencies you needed to install in addition to these)
- `pip install sklearn`
- `pip install pandas`
- `pip install "ipython[notebook]"`
- `pip install matplotlib`
- `pip install numpy`


## Pandas
### Your gateway to an Excel-free life

[Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) is a robust Data Science package with a powerful data structure known as a DataFrame. Pandas documentation is excellent and provides a thorough variety of tutorials and examples. I recommend their [10 Minutes to pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html) tutorial.

## NLTK
### Powerful Natural Language Processing with Python

I strongly recommend using the Natural Language ToolKit during your introductory steps into Natural Language Processing. The Toolkit has an [enjoyable to read book](http://www.nltk.org/book/) which simultaneously teaching natural language processing and the Python language with tangible, nontrivial examples in both regards. 
The NLTK creators have also added a [list of resources to wiki](https://github.com/nltk/nltk/wiki), including a *project ideas* page. 
####  NLTK Extras

The Natural Language Toolkit comes with a lot of features built into it, and still many others that you're probably never going to use (for example, a multitude of languages, or a series of tagged texts including parts of the Torah, Jane Austen's Emma, and an online chatroom in the 90s. Many of these packages have uses, for example training classifiers for a given topic, but they need to be downloaded using the [NLTK Downloader, which you can use through the command line while in interactive python mode.](http://www.nltk.org/data.html)
